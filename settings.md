Review the Alert Settings page and examine all related files and code.

Align this page with the Alerts page so the two function as complementary and fully synchronized components.

Create a dedicated Admin Alert Control Panel with full permissions, controls, and management capabilities.

Avoid duplicating settings between pages. One interface should handle alert control and delivery for users, while the admin panel manages system-wide configurations.

Update, optimize, and configure the page to ensure alert settings and workflows are modern, efficient, and well-structured.

Create or refine specialized settings for both users and administrators, ensuring clear separation of roles.

Ensure the settings structure includes:

User-level settings

Admin-level settings

Keep the page consistent, coordinated, and complementary with the Alerts page.

Make the settings practical and simple. The user should only be required to provide their email address and Telegram account, while the system manages the rest automatically.

Build, refine, or modify the page to improve usability, functionality, and integration with the alert system.
